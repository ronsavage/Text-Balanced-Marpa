- Stop including the string 'Error: ' twice in error messages.
- Stop the option print_warnings from printing the tree. Leave that to the caller.
- Change docs to match.
- Change scripts/*.pl and t/*.t to match.
- Change the output of tree2string() where there was an extra vertical dash at the start of the
last line in some cases (which the original code in Tree::DAG_Node did not print).
- Clean up the docs.
- Rename t/parenthises.t to t/parentheses.t.
