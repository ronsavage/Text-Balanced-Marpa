- Change the default value for text() from '' to \''.
- Add the length() and pos() mutators, to allow the user to control the call to the recognizer's
read() method. See the FAQ.
- Add the exhaustion_is_fatal option. See error_number() == 6 for details.
- Add t/skip.prefix.t to demonstrate pos() and length().
- Add scripts/tiny.pl for quick tests without Test::More.
- Add the escape_char() mutator, to allow the user to overrider the default backslash escape char.
- Add t/non.default.escapes.t to demonstrate escape_char().
- Add more error numbers, corresponding the 'die's which were not previously consistent with the
way error_numbers and error_messages should be set.
- comment explicitly all 'die's within the scope of try{} catch{}, and visa versa. This affects
how 'Error: ' is only added once to error messages being printed.

Comments= <<EOT
- Stop including the string 'Error: ' twice in error messages.
- Stop the option print_warnings from printing the tree. Leave that to the caller.
- Change docs to match.
- Change scripts/*.pl and t/*.t to match.
- Change the output of tree2string() where there was an extra vertical dash at the start of the
last line in some cases (which the original code in Tree::DAG_Node did not print).
- Clean up the docs.
- Rename t/parenthises.t to t/parentheses.t.
