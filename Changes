Revision history for Perl extension Text::Balanced::Marpa.

1.02  Wed Dec 31 11:10:00 2014
	- Change the default value for text() from '' to \''.
	- Add the length() and pos() mutators, to allow the user to control the call to the recognizer's
		read() method. See the FAQ.
	- Add the exhaustion_is_fatal option. See error_number() == 6 for details.
	- Add t/skip.prefix.t to demonstrate pos() and length().
	- Add scripts/tiny.pl for quick tests without Test::More.
	- Add the escape_char() mutator, to allow the user to overrider the default backslash escape char.
	- Add t/non.default.escapes.t to demonstrate escape_char().
	- Add more error numbers, corresponding the 'die's which were not previously consistent with the
		way error_numbers and error_messages should be set.
	- comment explicitly all 'die's within the scope of try{} catch{}, and visa versa. This affects
		how 'Error: ' is only added once to error messages being printed.

1.01  Mon Dec 29 08:41:00 2014
	- Stop including the string 'Error: ' twice in error messages.
	- Stop the option print_warnings from printing the tree. Leave that to the caller.
	- Change docs to match.
	- Change scripts/*.pl and t/*.t to match.
	- Change the output of tree2string() where there was an extra vertical dash at the start of the
		last line in some cases (which the original code in Tree::DAG_Node did not print).
	- Clean up the docs.
	- Rename t/parenthises.t to t/parentheses.t.
